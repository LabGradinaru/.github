# The Gradinaru Lab

We use fluorescence-based techniques to quantitatively probe the structure and dynamics of proteins at the single-molecule-level.
In particular, we make use of single-molecule FRET, photobleaching, tracking and correlation spectroscopies to gain a better understanding of biological systems, beyond the ensemble average.
These techniques, when coupled with computational tools, furnish an ideal testbed for complex and rapidly evolving biomolecules such as proteins and RNA.

Software largely pertains to the analysis of data collected via these methods as well as simulations of them - at various degrees of granularity.
